Air Passenger Traffic Analysis (India)

Key Analyses Performed:

1)Computed daily airport footfalls, covering both domestic and international movements.

2)Derived total footfalls by summing domestic and international passenger counts.

3)Identified maximum and minimum footfalls along with their corresponding dates.

4)Calculated the daily average footfalls across the dataset.

5)Summarized the busiest days using top N records with highest5) footfalls.

6)Highlighted the least busy days using bottom N records with lowest footfalls.

7)Analyzed monthly trends in footfall data to observe seasonal patterns.

8)Merged and cleaned two datasets: Daily Stats and City-wise Passenger Data.

9)Computed and analyzed average footfalls by city pairs (origin-destination).

10)Visualized the top 10 city pairs by average passengers traveling to the destination city (PaxToCity2).

All data processing was done using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), and the results are ready for further visualization in tools like Tableau or Plotly.
